üëã Hey there, I'm Zaid. I'm a student currently pursuing full-stack web development in my free time.

I enjoy leveraging technologies such as TypeScript, Next.js, Flutter, Postgres, Supabase, and many others to create scalable and performant web applications, and I'm constantly looking for projects to develop and things to learn in order to expand my knowledge and skillset further.

If you choose to donate (any amount is appreciated), the funds will help cover expenses such as domain names, server hosting, and equipment to maximize my coding workflow. Feel free to hit me up and let me know you've donated as well, I'd be more than happy to feature you on my GitHub profile or projects as a little "thank you" üëç
