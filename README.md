## GitHub Sponsors can be a hassle to set up for minors, so here's my workaround.

See an example of what it looks like [below](https://sponsor.zaidmkz.xyz).

If you would like to deploy this and accept donations yourself, here's what to do:
- Fork this repository
- Change the `src/info.ts` file (this is where you put your information, such as username, description, featured repos, etc.)
- Deploy (with Vercel, preferably)

As always, feel free to leave a star :star: as it helps a ton, and means a lot. :)
